# Mathematical notations

## basic sets in size increasing order

$\mathbb{N}$ = **Natural Numbers**    

Integer numbers larger than 0.

$\mathbb{Z}$ = **Integers**

All integer numbers.

$\mathbb{Q}$ = **Rational Numbers**

Numbers that can be described by fractions of integer numbers $p/q$. Decimal expansions of rational numbers either has an ending (0.15) or they have a sequece that repeats indefinitely (1.135135135135135135135... and so on).

$\mathbb{P}$ = **Irrational Numbers**   

The decimal of irrational numbers continue indefinitely and do not repeat. e.g $\pi, \sqrt{2}$. 

## other symbols 

$\subseteq$ = **Subset** 

$B \subseteq A$ – the subset ($B$) is _equal_ _to_ _or_ _smaller_ than the superset ($A$). 

$\subset$ = **Proper subset**

$C \subset A$ – the proper subset ($C$) is _strictly_ _smaller_ than the superset ($A$)
