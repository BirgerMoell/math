## Cartesian

Imagine having set of persons and a set of chores and you are extremely interested in fairness! THAT interested in how to distribute the chores among persons (or how to best distribute the persons among chores). 

## Binary relations

**Example: (A binary relation between A and B is a subset of the power set of the cartesian product AxB)**<br>

(draft)
The cartesian product of A and B is \emph{all pairs} such that a in A and b in B. Thus, these include all possible ways of pairing a single element in A with a single element in B. 

A relation between A and B is a set of pairs of element.

The power set of the cartesian product of A and B is the set of all subsets of the cartesian product. Thus such subsets are collections of pairs (a,b). Since the power set is all possible subsets, any set composed of pairs of elements a in A and b in B will be one of these subsets. Thus every relation is an element of the power set of the cartesian product. 


**Example: (Integers and prime numbers)**<br>

(draft)
An example of a relation is the "divides" relation between the set of integers and the set of prime numbers. We can consider pairs of integers and prime numbers such as (a,b) such that $a \in \mathbb{N}$ and $ \{b \in \mathbb{N} | b is prime\}$.
