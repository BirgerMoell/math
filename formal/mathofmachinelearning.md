## section{Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is modeled as a Markov decision
process:
- a set of environment and agent states, S
- a set of actions, A,
of the agent

Pa(s,s') = Pr(st+1 = s'|st = s' at = a)

$\sum$

$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1$$

$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx$

\(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\)

\(5 + 2 = 7\)

\(x2 + 5 = 10\)
