# Calculus
Calculus is the study of continous change.

It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus

## Differential calculus
Differential calculus is concerned with the
instantenous rate of change and slopes of curves.

## Integral calculus
Integral calculus is concerned with the accumulation of quantities and the areas
under and between curves.

## Derivative
The derivative of a function measure the sensitivity to change of the function value with
respect to a change in its argument.



## Limits and infinitesimals



## Mathematical analysis
