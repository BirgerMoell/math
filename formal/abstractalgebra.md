**Definition: (Homomorphism)**<br>
Let $A$ and $B$ be two algebraic structure (of the same type). $A$ and $B$ are said to be homomorphic if there exists a structure preserving map (homomorphism) between $A$ and $B$.

**Definition: (Isomorphism)**<br>
Let $A$ and $B$ be two algebraic structure (of the same type). $A$ and $B$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists a bijective homomorphism between $A$ and $B$.

**Definition: (Set isomorphism)**<br>
Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be isomorphic if there exists a bijection
between $A$ and $B$. That is, the cardinality of $A$ equals that of $B$.

**Definition: (Relation homomorphism)**<br>
A homomorphism between two relations $R_1$ on $A_1\times B_1$ and $R_2$ on
$A_2\times B_2$ is a function $f_A: A_1\times A_1 \to A_2\times B_2$
satisfying
\[ (a_1, b_1) \in R_1 \implies f(a_1, b_1) \in R_2 \]
for all $a_1 \in A_1, b_1 \in B_1$.
